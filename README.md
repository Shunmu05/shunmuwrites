Welcome to my storytelling world! I'm Shunmuga Nathan, a chemistry enthusiast and aspiring writer. I hold a master's degree in chemistry and am set to embark on a doctoral journey at NYCU, Taiwan. When I'm not in the lab, I'm lost in the world of words, crafting stories that I'd love to share with you.
